taking away the screenshot of the receipt is just silly worse is the download button putting copy of the screenshot which you prevented to be taken in the downloads folder where we cant attach directly from whatsapp millions of people use the screenshot as proof of payment transfer yet you make that harder for everyone have every user contacts the developer or manager who made this awful decision,CBE,"['Transaction Performance', 'User Interface', 'Customer Support']"
very good ape,CBE,[]
new update version keeps crashing it needs maintenance,CBE,['Feature Requests']
the update is unneeded,CBE,[]
as if the update of march can take screenshot in the ape can just save it as file and that is so annoying used to save all screenshot in my gallery in one folder now with the extra steps added have to save the file go to file and then screenshot it the solution is to allow the screenshot to be save in to gallery automatically wish you give this review attention and resolve the issue shortly,CBE,"['User Interface', 'Customer Support', 'Feature Requests']"
it is good ape but when make inter bank transaction it can display the receiver account number and name of receiver and also receiver bank,CBE,"['Account Access', 'Transaction Performance', 'User Interface']"

the not allowing the ape while developer options is on needs to be fixed why the hell is an ape telling me what to do with my own os this is an unnecessary fix that needs to be fixed,CBE,['Feature Requests']
the recent update automatically turns the developers option on and when one starts the ape message pops up saying the ape does not work with the developers option on so one has to go to the settings and manually turn the developers option off otherwise the ape does work,CBE,['Feature Requests']

the update in working,CBE,[]
as an ape developer rely on developer mode to build and test apes but this ape blocks access entirely if it enabled this restriction is unnecessary and makes it impossible for developers to use the service instead of outright blocking consider implementing enhanced security measures that don alienate professionals who need this setting please reconsider this policy,CBE,"['Account Access', 'User Interface', 'Customer Support', 'Feature Requests']"

really like this ape as it is being updated from time to time and includes multiple payment options in particular giving receipt makes it even more preferable however when it is refreshed it does not show the history of credit and deposit in order and am of the opinion that it is better if the recent history is fixed respectively according to the transaction date in the future because there is problem of confusion,CBE,"['Transaction Performance', 'Customer Support', 'Feature Requests']"
this application is very nice mobile banking agent and various transactions can be used download and use,CBE,['Transaction Performance']
